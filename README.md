# Welcome to the Series of Python Workshops!

Hello, Amir ElTabakh here aka sfnxboy!

I have the privilege to be a Mentor for Girls Who Code Queen’s College. I’ll be teaching Python Fall 21, and we have a lot planned. This Python Series will consist of 4 workshops, details below. 

Intro to Python (September 22, 2021) \\
Master the basics of Python. Python is a general-purpose programming language that is becoming ever more popular for data science. Learn to create variables, run loops, create an manipulate lists and write functions in Python. We will also use powerful Python packages to access, explore and manipulate data!

Pandas\\
Pandas is the most popular Python library. Programmers use it for everything from data manipulation to data analysis. We'll go over the basics of Pandas, learn how to explore data and calculate summary statistics, manipulate data, and create visualizations.  

Natural Language Processing \\
In this workshop we'll explore some basic NLP concepts such as word tokenization and Regular Expressions and text pre-processing. We will also introduce topic identification, extracting the who, what and where of your texts, and performing sentiment analysis.  

Web Scraping\\
The ability to build tools capable of retrieving and parsing information stored across the internet is incredibly valuable. After a brief introduction to HTML, we'll build bots to scrape data off the internet. We'll also review the ethics of web scraping, and best practices.  

Image Processing\\
Learn how to extract data, transform and analyze images using the NumPy and SciKit-image packages. This workshop will also teach you how to restore images, remove objects, logos, text and damages areas in pictures! We'll also touch on detecting objects such as faces, profiles, and your favorite pets in images.
