# Welcome to the Series of Python Workshops!

Hello, Amir ElTabakh here aka [sfnxboy](https://github.com/sfnxboy)!

I have the privilege to be a Mentor for Girls Who Code Queen’s College. I’ll be teaching Python Fall 21, and we have a lot planned. This Python Series will consist of 4 workshops, details below. The IDE we will be using is Jupyter Notebook, which is easily [installed](https://github.com/GWC-QC/Python_Series/blob/main/SetUp/Anaconda%20Python%20Installation%20and%20Jupyter%20Notebook.pdf) with the Anaconda software.

Each workshop will have a number of components.
- Main workshop which will be uploaded as an `.ipynb` file
- The Key to the main workshop lesson. Note: Theres more than one way to go about some of the challenges
- Breakout Room Practice which will also be uploaded as an `.ipynb` filw
- Workshop Challenge

Each workshop will come with its own take-home Workshop Challenge! It will test your skills in some real life application. Not everything you need to solve the challenge will be gone over in the workshop, so you'll have to utilize your Google-Fu skills. There is so much documentation out there waiting for you. Work on it with your friends, find innovative ways to solve the challenge, and gain exposure to the plentiful Python libraries and functions out there.

You have full permission to take the lesson and Workshop Challenge and post them on your own GitHub page! In fact, I encourage it. If you don't have a GitHub account yet, sign up [here](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)!

### Workshops

**Intro to Python (September 22, 2021)** \
Master the basics of Python. Python is a general-purpose programming language that is becoming ever more popular for data science. Learn to create variables, run loops, create an manipulate lists and write functions in Python. We will also use powerful Python packages to access, explore and manipulate data!

**Pandas**\
Pandas is the most popular Python library. Programmers use it for everything from data manipulation to data analysis. We'll go over the basics of Pandas, learn how to explore data and calculate summary statistics, manipulate data, and create visualizations.  

**Web Scraping** \
The ability to build tools capable of retrieving and parsing information stored across the internet is incredibly valuable. After a brief introduction to HTML, we'll build bots to scrape data off the internet. We'll also review the ethics of web scraping, and best practices.  

**Image Processing** \
Learn how to extract data, transform and analyze images using the NumPy and SciKit-image packages. This workshop will also teach you how to restore images, remove objects, logos, text and damages areas in pictures! We'll also touch on detecting objects such as faces, profiles, and your favorite pets in images.
