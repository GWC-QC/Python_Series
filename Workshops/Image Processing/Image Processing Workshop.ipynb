    "**Welcome** to the fourth and final Python workshop of the Fall 21 semester! Today we'll learn how to transform and manipulate images as you like! Image processing is a method to perform operations on images to enhance them, extract useful information and even analyze them. Image processing is a subset of Computer Vision, and it has a wide range of applications such as the analysis of medical images, artificial intelligence, image restoration, surveillance, robotic vision, automotive safety and others.\n",

    "Reconstructing lost parts of an image is called inpainting, and there is a scikit-image module for it! We can apply inpainting with the inpaint bihormonic function from the restoration module. It needs the location of the damaged pixels to be filled, as a mask on top of the image, in order to work. A mask image is simply an image where some of the pixel intensity values are 0, and others are non-zero (likely 1)."

    "\n",
    "Over the past few years, facial detection has attracted a lot of attention and caused a great impact on automated processes through artificial vision. Several social network platforms and smart-phones are using face detection to know if there is someone in a picture, and if so, to apply filters, add focus on the face area, or recommend you to tag friends! \n",
    "\n",
    "With scikit-image we can detect faces using a machine learning classifier, with just a couple of lines! We won't be covering machine learning concepts in depth, but it's important to know that we use a cascade of classifiers, which is like using multiple classifiers at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "The coolest piece of technology in the following code (it's all super cool though), is the detector. To apply the detector on images, we need to use the detext_multi_scale method, from the same cascade class. This method searches for the object, in this case a face. It creates a window that will be moving through the image until it finds something similar to a human face. Searching happens on multiple scales. The window will have a minimum size to spot the small or far-away faces, and a maximum size to spot the larger faces in the image. The `scale_factor` parameter can be tuned by the programmer, this parameter determines how large the searching window scales after each search."
