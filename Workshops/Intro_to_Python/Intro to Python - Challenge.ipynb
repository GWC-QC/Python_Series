For instance, imagine you have a dataset that contains people's names, emails, and extra metadata about them. Iterating over the columns of contacts and names can allow you to send out mass emails. You can even use a conditional statement to send emails to individuals who satisfy specified conditions. Just build a basic program for now, but keep this in mind for the future. We'll build on this challenge in the Pandas workshop challenge. There are libraries to automate this process with gmail too, its just about exploring whats out there."
