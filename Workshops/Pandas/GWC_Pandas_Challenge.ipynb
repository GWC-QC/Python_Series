    "The best way to learn how to program is by working on projects. We'll be accessing the Spotify API in this challenge. I will supply the code to access a playlist and extract meta-data from it (which all can be found by Google-ing it). The Spotify-data exploration project is a fun one. You can take it a step forward and build recommendation engines on your apps, or regression/classification models (it has been done before, Google it). Just make sure you collect the enough training data. We access Playlists in this code, accessing your own liked songs is a little tricky but its possible. Also, you can only access your own liked songs (in case you plan on snooping on your friends music). So get a large training data set for a machine learning model simply get the Playlist ID for a massive playlist.\n",
